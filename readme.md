# GPATool - SGPA Calculator

This project is a simple web application that allows students to calculate their Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on their expected grades and credit scores for each course in a given semester. The user inputs the number of courses they are taking, and the application dynamically generates input fields for each course's credit score and expected grade. Upon submission, the application calculates the SGPA and displays the result.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of courses in the current semester.
2. For each course, enter the credit score and expected grade.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the expected SGPA.
